Inheritence:
=============

* We can access one class property or methods from another class.
* Code reusablity
* Keyword "extends"
* Reduce memory wastage

Types:
=====
1) Single Inheritance
2) Multiple Inheritance-This 
3) Multilevel Inheritance
4) Hierarichal Inheritance


1) Single Inheritance
----------------------
Combination of One parent Class and One child Class

2) Multiple Inheritance->this concept can be achived from Interface.
=======================
Will not work from Java which can be achived by Interface.

3)Multilevel Inheritance:
=========================

ClassA -Parent

ClassB extends ClassA -Subclass or child class

---> Which has both ClassA and ClassB methods.

ClassC extends ClassB
----> Which ClassB and classC methods.

More than one parent will access from the child as tree like strucure.

====================================================================

4) Hierarichal Inheritance
========================= -> One parent more than one child.

ClassA-Parent-Ex: Base class 

ClassB extends ClassA

ClassC extends ClassA

ClassD extends ClassA
